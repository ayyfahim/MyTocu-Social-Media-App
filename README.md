You will see the friends tab on the website&#39;s homepage where you can see all the posts, journals and list of your friends.

- **Send Friend Request** : You can send friend request to any user on the platform (if the profile is set to Public). The cool thing about this is they will receive a **real-time live notification** when you press the **send request** button.

- **Accept Friend Request** : When the user gets a friend request notification they can **accept** the Friend Request by clicking on the notification, it will redirect them to the other person&#39;s profile page. And when that user accepts a Friend Request the other user will also get a **real-time notification**.

### Authentication

_**Create Posts + Cropping while Uploading Image + Validation + Receive updates**
**Live Messaging or Chatting with friend + See who&#39;s online + Has typing indicator + Attachment to messages**
**Email Verification + Field Verifications**_

The website&#39;s register page has a simple design. It&#39;s the first page you are redirected to when you put the domain name.

- It has strong validation on the backend. So no one can&#39;t use fake data or accidentally put the wrong data on the wrong field. (ex: putting your full name on the email field)
- After registration you will receive a verification email with a link. You have to click on the link to verify your account otherwise you can&#39;t use your account. It prevents dummy accounts and fake users.
- You can now login with your email and password.
